Frames are a frequently misunderstood part of buying a bike.
There are tons of measurements and nobody seems to know what
they all do. If I tell you a bike has a 625mm effective top
tube, 38.1mm rake, 71.0 head tube angle, 423mm chainstay,
and 74mm trail, would you be able to tell me the handling
characteristics of that bike? I thought not. The simple truth
is that nobody really can. Some people know more about what
each of these measurements mean than others, but the only way
to know for sure how a bike is going to ride is to ride it.
That being said, there are a few simple things to look for
when looking for a bike frame.

## Trail

Trail is frequently quoted as being the composite of the rake
and head tube angle. It's ok, I didn't really know what that
means either. The easier way to think of it is the amount that
the wheel "trails" behind the forks.

A general rule of thumb is that a large trail will give you
more high speed stability but will not allow tight cornering.
A short trail will allow more responsive turning at the expense
of stability. A lot of manufacturers don't give trail
as a measurement but instead give you only angle and rake.
Using angle and rake, trail can be calculated using a
[calculator](http://yojimg.net/bike/web_tools/trailcalc.php).

* Long trail gives high speed stability
* Short trail allows more agility

## Bottom Bracket Height

The bottom bracket height mostly affects stability and
balance. A lower bottom bracket means a lower center of gravity
and a more stable riding position. The tradeoff is that
a bottom bracket that is too low can cause issues with ground
clearance and pedals may hit the ground in turns. Bottom bracket
height comes down to preference. Some riders like a lower 12"
bracket because they like the low center of gravity, while
others want 13.5" because they want to be able to pedal through
turns without worrying about hitting the ground.

* Low bottom bracket is more stable
* High bottom bracket gives more obstacle clearance

## Chainstay length

The effect of the chainstay length is one of the most important
factors when talking about the characteristics of a bike frame.
Chainstay length affects the weight distribution, wheelbase,
and rigidity of a bike frame.

Proper weight distribution will cause the rider to feel more
stable on downhills, and faster on uphills because the rear tire
won't slip and the front tire will stay solidly connected to
the ground. Longer chainstays allow the rider to put weight on the
rear tire without fear of the front tire lifting off the ground.
A chainstay that is too long, however, will make it difficult to
put enough weight on the rear tire and allow it to slip.

Chainstays most obviously affects wheelbase. A longer wheelbase
will feel more stable, especially at high speeds. A short wheelbase
will feel lighter and more agile in techinical turning sections.
This is really up to the preference of the rider.

The final thing a chainstay affects is rigidity. A more rigid
chainstay will more efficiently transfer energy from the pedals
to the ground. Generally, shorter chainstays are more rigid.
Long chainstays have more leverage and flex more, absorbing more
energy. These days, materials exist to allow for long chainstays
that are still very rigid, however this will make them heavier
and more expensive.

* Long chainstays allow more stability and faster climbing
* Short chainstays allow faster turning and more rigid frames
