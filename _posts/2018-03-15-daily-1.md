> Given an array of numbers, return whether any two sums to K.
> For example, given [10, 15, 3, 7] and K of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17.

## Solution 1

```javascript
const arr = [10, 15, 3, 7]
const target = 17;

function sums(arr, val) {
  let out = false;

  arr.forEach((x, i) => {
    arr.slice(i+1).forEach((y, j) => {
      if (x + y === target) {
        out = true;
      }
    })
  });
  return out;
}

console.log(sums(arr, target));
```

### Runtime: O(n^2)

### Proof of correctness

Program terminates because both loops have clearly defined ending points (length of the array).

output is initialized to false.

Every pair of integers in the array is tested.

`out` can only be set to true if the currently tested pair sums to k.

`out` can not be set back to false once it is set to true.
